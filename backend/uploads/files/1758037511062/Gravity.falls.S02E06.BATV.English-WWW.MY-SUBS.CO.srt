00:00:11,133 --> 00:00:13,100
Well, hello there, traveler.

2
00:00:13,135 --> 00:00:16,169
I see your car broke down
on this lonesome country road,

3
00:00:16,205 --> 00:00:19,740
a place so remote that no one
can hear your screams!

4
00:00:20,843 --> 00:00:22,059
Pretend I didn't say that.

5
00:00:22,094 --> 00:00:24,077
Come in, come in,
but be warned,

6
00:00:24,113 --> 00:00:28,065
if you enter you may be
subjected to my tales.

7
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:31,885
Tales designed
to sell my merchandise!

8
00:00:36,992 --> 00:00:39,893
Sorry, I was thinking of
something funny I heard earlier.

00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:24,037
You've come to
the Mystery Shack after-hours,

11
00:01:24,073 --> 00:01:26,039
a time when only our creepiest

12
00:01:26,075 --> 00:01:28,125
and most cursed
objects are for sale,

13
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,110
like that thing there!

14
00:01:31,847 --> 00:01:34,164
No, not a fan?
Too many orifices?

15
00:01:34,216 --> 00:01:36,883
All right, I can tell
what you're looking for

16
00:01:36,919 --> 00:01:38,985
is this disembodied hand.

17
00:01:39,021 --> 00:01:40,220
Why is it so expensive?

18
00:01:40,255 --> 00:01:42,989
Well, that's quite a tale

19
00:01:43,025 --> 00:01:46,493
and it's called Hands Off!

20
00:01:46,629 --> 00:01:48,629
No, seriously, hands off,
that's not for sale.

21
00:01:48,864 --> 00:01:49,863
All right.

22
00:01:49,898 --> 00:01:51,164
Hands Off!

23
00:01:56,105 --> 00:01:58,238
Swap meet!
Swap meet! Swap meet!

24
00:01:58,273 --> 00:02:00,774
Look at all these
priceless treasures.

25
00:02:00,826 --> 00:02:03,143
Bobbly-heads!

26
00:02:03,178 --> 00:02:05,112
They agree with
everything I say.

27
00:02:05,164 --> 00:02:06,980
Professor glasses!

28
00:02:07,015 --> 00:02:08,815
They make me look
like a genius.

29
00:02:10,853 --> 00:02:14,888
Look at these faux-gold beauties.
They're mob-boss quality.

30
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:22,129
All right, kids, prepare to watch
the delicate art of the deal.

31
00:02:22,164 --> 00:02:25,866
Hey, hag-face!
How much for the junk watches?

32
00:02:25,901 --> 00:02:27,868
They are not for sale.

33
00:02:27,903 --> 00:02:30,854
Not for you, Stan Pines!

34
00:02:30,889 --> 00:02:33,723
The wind whispers your name!

35
00:02:35,027 --> 00:02:37,077
Shh...
Shush, you guys.

36
00:02:37,112 --> 00:02:38,945
All right, I get it,
you're creepy.

37
00:02:38,981 --> 00:02:41,148
Anyway, less talky,
more watchy!

38
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:44,985
Get your hands off my watch!

39
00:02:44,987 --> 00:02:46,753
Ugh!

40
00:02:46,788 --> 00:02:48,054
Yeesh!
Freak show.

41
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:51,074
Wow, someone needs to work
on their social skills.

42
00:02:51,126 --> 00:02:52,792
And their observation skills.

43
00:02:52,828 --> 00:02:53,994
Boom!

44
00:02:54,029 --> 00:02:56,830
Good job, heisting hands.
Mwah, mwah.

45
00:02:56,865 --> 00:02:59,900
Grunkle Stan, are you seriously
shoplifting from a witch?

46
00:02:59,935 --> 00:03:01,101
That sounded like a curse.

47
00:03:01,136 --> 00:03:03,003
"That sounded
like a curse!"

48
00:03:03,038 --> 00:03:05,005
Hey, anyone want
to buy a wet blanket?

49
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,840
We got a wet blanket for sale!

50
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:12,812
I can't survive
in this market.

51
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:16,183
Ha, curse.

52
00:03:16,218 --> 00:03:17,184
Yeah, right.

53
00:03:17,219 --> 00:03:19,085
Ah!

54
00:03:19,121 --> 00:03:22,022
Wait, is this curse ugly
or normal ugly?

55
00:03:22,057 --> 00:03:24,824
Looks like
I got off scot-free.

56
00:03:29,114 --> 00:03:30,897
All right, kiddos,
breakfast time.

57
00:03:30,933 --> 00:03:32,032
Prepare your mouths for--

58
00:03:33,202 --> 00:03:35,902
Whoa! Whoa-ah!
No hands!

59
00:03:35,938 --> 00:03:38,805
Grunkle Stan,
what happened to your hands?

60
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,840
So I might have
got cursed a little,

61
00:03:40,876 --> 00:03:42,116
but the watch
looks nice, right?

62
00:03:42,144 --> 00:03:47,781
Foolish man, thieving hands
find wicked face!

63
00:03:47,816 --> 00:03:50,584
You must return
what isn't yours...

64
00:03:50,819 --> 00:03:51,785
That's better.

65
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:53,186
I told you, Grunkle Stan,

66
00:03:53,222 --> 00:03:55,188
you got to give that
watch back and apologize.

67
00:03:55,224 --> 00:03:56,856
What?

68
00:03:56,892 --> 00:03:58,858
That old crone
should apologize to me

69
00:03:58,894 --> 00:04:00,994
for denying my right
to buy cheap junk.

70
00:04:01,029 --> 00:04:03,763
I don't need hands,
I've got self respect.

71
00:04:07,903 --> 00:04:10,987
Mabel, sweetie, will you
make your uncle some hands?

72
00:04:11,339 --> 00:04:14,908
La-la-la.
Hands makeover!

73
00:04:15,043 --> 00:04:18,111
Say hello to your "new hands"!
In quotes.

74
00:04:18,146 --> 00:04:19,179
Nice work, kid.

75
00:04:19,214 --> 00:04:21,181
See, hands are overrated.

76
00:04:21,216 --> 00:04:23,750
I'm ready to take on the day!

77
00:04:24,202 --> 00:04:25,952
Ma'am.

78
00:04:35,897 --> 00:04:37,797
Hey, Mr. Pines.

79
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:40,900
Should we play toss me
a dozen eggs like we always do?

80
00:04:40,936 --> 00:04:43,069
No, Jimmy, wait!
Not today!

81
00:04:43,105 --> 00:04:45,071
Not today!

82
00:04:47,909 --> 00:04:49,075
Let's find that witch.

83
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:53,113
According
to the swap meet pamphlet,

84
00:04:53,165 --> 00:04:55,181
the hand witch lives
in a horrible hand witch lair

85
00:04:55,217 --> 00:04:56,216
on Hand Witch Mountain.

86
00:04:56,251 --> 00:04:58,151
Stop saying hand witch!

87
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:03,957
Grunkle Stan, did you
just tap my shoulder?

88
00:05:04,009 --> 00:05:05,675
Kid, I can't tap anything.

89
00:05:07,179 --> 00:05:09,996
Guys, can you stop tapping
both my shoulders?

90
00:05:19,725 --> 00:05:21,141
Hands!
Lots of hands!

91
00:05:23,195 --> 00:05:24,694
Ah!

92
00:05:29,985 --> 00:05:31,951
Ah!

93
00:05:36,224 --> 00:05:38,992
Look at this touching scene.

94
00:05:39,044 --> 00:05:40,827
Up top!

95
00:05:40,862 --> 00:05:42,195
You guys, you guys get me.

96
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:44,764
All right, you horrible wench,
you got me.

97
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,716
Stealing is wrong,
etcetera, take it.

98
00:05:46,752 --> 00:05:48,134
Now can I have my hands back?

99
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:50,970
I have a certain gesture
I'd like to share with you.

100
00:05:51,006 --> 00:05:55,091
Alas, your hands cannot
be gotten so easily.

101
00:05:55,143 --> 00:05:58,178
The spirits say, um...

102
00:05:58,213 --> 00:06:02,949
that the curse can
only be broken by a kiss!

103
00:06:02,984 --> 00:06:04,751
What?

104
00:06:04,786 --> 00:06:06,720
It's all right, kids.

105
00:06:06,755 --> 00:06:07,887
Just look away.

106
00:06:11,193 --> 00:06:13,159
A kiss on the lips!

107
00:06:13,195 --> 00:06:16,162
What? Forget it!
I'm not kissing any of that mess.

108
00:06:16,198 --> 00:06:17,964
I don't need
my hands that bad.

109
00:06:17,999 --> 00:06:19,899
Yeah, you're just
making stuff up now.

110
00:06:19,935 --> 00:06:21,034
Let's go, kids.

111
00:06:21,069 --> 00:06:23,002
No, wait!
Don't go!

112
00:06:23,038 --> 00:06:24,838
You're right, you're right.

113
00:06:24,873 --> 00:06:27,107
I was just making
all that stuff up.

114
00:06:27,142 --> 00:06:29,876
Just trying to get
something going, you know.

115
00:06:29,928 --> 00:06:31,911
So hard to meet
people these days.

116
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:35,949
So this was all just
a ploy to get a date?

117
00:06:35,984 --> 00:06:37,751
I'm desperate, okay?

118
00:06:37,786 --> 00:06:39,753
But every time I bring
someone back here

119
00:06:39,788 --> 00:06:42,989
without keeping their hands
hostage, they just run away!

120
00:06:43,024 --> 00:06:44,924
Well, yeah, look
at this horror show.

121
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,860
It's creepy even for a cave!

122
00:06:46,895 --> 00:06:48,194
You just need to redecorate.

123
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:50,764
For example...

124
00:06:50,799 --> 00:06:52,799
A handelabra!

125
00:06:53,969 --> 00:06:56,436
Ooh, the hand witch likes.

126
00:06:56,472 --> 00:06:57,771
Then watch me work.

127
00:06:57,906 --> 00:07:00,824
Home makeover!

128
00:07:03,945 --> 00:07:05,011
Redecorate.

129
00:07:06,965 --> 00:07:08,681
Redo you.

130
00:07:10,786 --> 00:07:12,685
Change it around.

131
00:07:12,721 --> 00:07:15,004
You got to do it
to make it work.

132
00:07:16,892 --> 00:07:20,794
Okay. Time to take a look
at your fantastic new cave.

133
00:07:22,831 --> 00:07:24,981
Men will definitely
tolerate you now.

134
00:07:25,016 --> 00:07:27,934
And I left a book of pickup
lines on the end table.

135
00:07:27,969 --> 00:07:30,036
Blah!
Oh, my goodness!

136
00:07:30,071 --> 00:07:31,971
I can't believe
this is the same cave!

137
00:07:32,007 --> 00:07:33,106
Oh, my goodness!

138
00:07:33,141 --> 00:07:35,141
I just can't find the words.

139
00:07:35,177 --> 00:07:37,143
How about "Here's
your hands back"?

140
00:07:37,179 --> 00:07:38,812
Oh, right.

141
00:07:44,186 --> 00:07:46,019
Shaky, Scratchy.

142
00:07:46,054 --> 00:07:47,954
I've missed you old rascals.

143
00:07:47,989 --> 00:07:49,789
You're all right, sister.

144
00:07:51,226 --> 00:07:52,959
Will you be my boyfriend now?

145
00:07:52,994 --> 00:07:54,727
No, never.

146
00:07:54,763 --> 00:07:56,729
Well, I learned nothing.

147
00:07:56,765 --> 00:07:59,899
Back to my crippling
loneliness.

148
00:07:59,935 --> 00:08:02,702
Hey, I'm lost
in these mountains.

149
00:08:02,737 --> 00:08:04,137
Could I crash here
for the night?

150
00:08:04,172 --> 00:08:07,006
Please, come in. Uh...

151
00:08:09,077 --> 00:08:11,144
"Girl, are those space pants?

152
00:08:11,179 --> 00:08:14,781
Because your butt looks
out of this world."

153
00:08:14,816 --> 00:08:16,115
Wow.
Thanks for noticing.

154
00:08:16,151 --> 00:08:17,750
Yes!

155
00:08:18,519 --> 00:08:20,537
All right, I get it.

156
00:08:20,572 --> 00:08:23,356
You don't want the hand,
you're a savvy customer.

157
00:08:23,392 --> 00:08:25,775
But perhaps you'd be
interested in buying, um...

158
00:08:28,397 --> 00:08:29,679
this magic pig.

159
00:08:29,698 --> 00:08:31,548
Sure he doesn't look magic,

160
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:33,683
but there
is a very interesting story

161
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:35,418
I'm about
to make up about him,

162
00:08:35,454 --> 00:08:37,687
and it's called Abaconings!

163
00:08:41,827 --> 00:08:43,627
"The What-The-Heck-A-Hedron!

164
00:08:43,662 --> 00:08:45,562
Solve this test
of intelligence

165
00:08:45,597 --> 00:08:48,565
and your photo
could be on this box."

166
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,501
Whoa. That's false advertising
I can get behind.

167
00:08:53,339 --> 00:08:56,173
Come on.

168
00:08:56,208 --> 00:08:58,208
Ugh!

169
00:08:58,443 --> 00:08:59,676
Ooh, that's a bummer.

170
00:08:59,711 --> 00:09:02,779
This is May May and The Hogg
coming at you on the AM.

171
00:09:03,815 --> 00:09:05,448
Whoa!

172
00:09:05,484 --> 00:09:07,450
Not sure we can say
that on the air.

173
00:09:07,486 --> 00:09:10,554
Don't touch that dial, truckers,
'cause The Hogg just ate it.

174
00:09:12,357 --> 00:09:13,657
Mabel, could you knock it off?

175
00:09:13,692 --> 00:09:15,659
I'm trying to solve
this intelligence puzzle,

176
00:09:15,694 --> 00:09:17,093
but it seems impossible.

177
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:20,764
Maybe you're just
not smart enough.

178
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:23,900
We'll see about that.

179
00:09:27,673 --> 00:09:30,774
Buried near the falls is
the legendary percepshroom.

180
00:09:30,809 --> 00:09:32,642
To increase brain power,
grind it up

181
00:09:32,678 --> 00:09:34,477
and apply to
the forehead overnight.

182
00:09:35,747 --> 00:09:38,481
Tomorrow, I own you!

183
00:10:05,777 --> 00:10:06,843
Ha-ha!

184
00:10:06,878 --> 00:10:08,678
I feel smarter already.

185
00:10:08,714 --> 00:10:11,548
The digits of pi are 3.1...

186
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:12,616
Um...

187
00:10:12,651 --> 00:10:15,485
<i>415926 etcetera.</i>

188
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,720
What?
Who said that?

189
00:10:16,755 --> 00:10:17,754
Mabel?

190
00:10:17,789 --> 00:10:19,623
Whoa!
Dipper, look.

191
00:10:22,661 --> 00:10:26,663
<i>Greetings, friends.
It is I, Waddles the pig.</i>

192
00:10:26,698 --> 00:10:28,531
- What?
- Waddles, what happened to you?

193
00:10:28,567 --> 00:10:30,800
Have you been possessed
by the spirit of a nerd?

194
00:10:30,836 --> 00:10:33,470
<i>I understand my transformation
may be vexing,</i>

195
00:10:33,505 --> 00:10:36,406
<i>but I have prepared
a presentation.</i>

196
00:10:36,441 --> 00:10:39,876
<i>Forgive me. My pig arms
are cute and useless.</i>

197
00:10:39,911 --> 00:10:42,879
The brain goop! You ate it
and built all this, didn't you?

198
00:10:42,914 --> 00:10:44,547
This isn't right!

199
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:46,850
The pig goes oink.
The pig goes oink!

200
00:10:46,885 --> 00:10:49,419
<i>Now the pig goes
wherever he can shine</i>

201
00:10:49,454 --> 00:10:51,821
<i>the light of knowledge into
the darkness of ignorance.</i>

202
00:10:51,857 --> 00:10:53,673
Whoa!
What the heck-a-hedron!

203
00:10:53,709 --> 00:10:55,592
How did you do that?

204
00:10:55,627 --> 00:10:58,428
<i>I can teach you, Dipper.
I can teach you many things.</i>

205
00:10:58,463 --> 00:11:00,563
<i>From the secrets
of astrophysics to the--</i>

206
00:11:00,599 --> 00:11:01,564
<i>Hey, hey!</i>

207
00:11:04,603 --> 00:11:06,770
Man, I am loving
this new Waddles.

208
00:11:06,805 --> 00:11:11,708
Yeah, he's, uh,
he's definitely... different.

209
00:11:16,448 --> 00:11:18,481
Dude, that rocket cart
is amazing!

210
00:11:18,533 --> 00:11:20,450
You and me
should go invent stuff.

211
00:11:20,485 --> 00:11:22,752
Uh, Waddles,
don't you want to stay up here

212
00:11:22,788 --> 00:11:24,854
and record some
morning pranks with me?

213
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:26,823
Mabel, this pig's got a gift.

214
00:11:26,858 --> 00:11:28,491
He needs to share it
with the world.

215
00:11:28,527 --> 00:11:29,826
<i>I'm sorry, Mabel.</i>

216
00:11:29,861 --> 00:11:31,861
<i>There is more to life than
making fart noises</i>

217
00:11:31,897 --> 00:11:34,531
<i>and laughing
at those fart noises.</i>

218
00:11:34,566 --> 00:11:35,665
<i>I see that now.</i>

219
00:11:37,669 --> 00:11:41,638
Yeah, you guys
just go on without me.

220
00:11:46,645 --> 00:11:48,611
Oh, my kite got
stuck in a tree.

221
00:11:48,647 --> 00:11:50,580
I hate everything!

222
00:11:50,615 --> 00:11:52,549
I bet we could be of service.

223
00:11:52,584 --> 00:11:54,751
Ah! An affront
against nature!

224
00:11:54,786 --> 00:11:56,519
<i>Ha! Forget kites.</i>

225
00:11:56,555 --> 00:11:58,688
<i>Here, take this rocket pack
I invented</i>

226
00:11:58,724 --> 00:12:00,657
<i>and explore
the heavens yourself.</i>

227
00:12:00,692 --> 00:12:05,162
Forget that, Grenda is gonna look
at cute boys through skylights.

228
00:12:09,701 --> 00:12:11,768
I rule the sky!

229
00:12:11,803 --> 00:12:14,504
Dude, that rocket pack
we made was amazing.

230
00:12:14,539 --> 00:12:16,673
<i>Don't forget the laser gun
we made for Candy.</i>

231
00:12:17,809 --> 00:12:19,609
That's to my enemies!

232
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:24,414
Welcome to May May
and The Hogg AM.

233
00:12:24,449 --> 00:12:25,715
Top story today,

234
00:12:25,751 --> 00:12:29,819

236
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:35,692
What did that nasty goop
do to you?

237
00:12:35,727 --> 00:12:38,862
You're not happier
like this, are you?

238
00:12:41,867 --> 00:12:44,768
Ha-ha. This is
your greatest invention yet.

239
00:12:44,803 --> 00:12:47,470
It could solve
every problem of mankind.

240
00:12:47,506 --> 00:12:51,624
<i>And bring me many potatoes,
delicious potatoes.</i>

241
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:54,711
<i>Yummy yummy

242
00:12:54,746 --> 00:12:56,613
What the heck is
going on here?

243
00:12:56,648 --> 00:13:00,583
<i>Mabel, you are just in time to
behold our greatest achievement.</i>

244
00:13:00,635 --> 00:13:02,986
<i>The smarticle accelerator!</i>

245
00:13:03,021 --> 00:13:06,389
Solving that brain puzzle
was just the tip of the iceberg.

246
00:13:06,425 --> 00:13:08,425
With this, Waddles will be
able to solve

247
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:10,460
all the greatest puzzles
of the universe.

248
00:13:10,495 --> 00:13:13,563
<i>The origin of life.

<i>Why dudes have nipples.</i>

00:13:17,502 --> 00:13:20,370
Soon your pig is gonna be
world famous,

251
00:13:20,405 --> 00:13:22,605
meeting with scientists,
presidents.

252
00:13:22,641 --> 00:13:25,175
I wonder if I can teach him
to wear pants.

253
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:26,543
The whole world?

254
00:13:26,578 --> 00:13:29,712
But when will you have time for us?
I'm your best friend.

255
00:13:29,748 --> 00:13:33,616
<i>I'm still your friend, Mabel.
But I'm helping people now.</i>

256
00:13:33,618 --> 00:13:35,552
But what about helping me?

257
00:13:35,587 --> 00:13:38,421
Do you really want to spend
your whole life in meetings

258
00:13:38,457 --> 00:13:39,722
with dumb smart guys?

259
00:13:39,758 --> 00:13:42,625
This brain junk has made you
forget who you are.

260
00:13:42,661 --> 00:13:44,661

<i>What good is helping the world</i>

266
00:14:03,448 --> 00:14:05,782
<i>if I can't help my favorite

267
00:14:05,817 --> 00:14:08,418
<i>It's a good thing
I built in a dum-dum switch.</i>

268
00:14:12,724 --> 00:14:14,724
Waddles!
Waddles, don't! Wait!

269
00:14:16,728 --> 00:14:17,895
<i>I'm sorry, Dipper.</i>

270
00:14:17,897 --> 00:14:21,364
<i>In my last eight seconds of
consciousness, I want you to know</i>

271
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:23,366
<i>that science is a horizon
to search for,</i>

272
00:14:23,401 --> 00:14:25,435
<i>not a prize
to hold in your hand.</i>

273
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:27,737
<i>Also I miss getting
my tummy tickled.</i>

274
00:14:30,475 --> 00:14:32,475
Oh, Waddles.

275
00:14:37,399 --> 00:14:39,482
No!
Our invention!

276
00:14:39,518 --> 00:14:41,818
I know what will make you
feel better.

277
00:14:41,853 --> 00:14:44,654
A simple hug
from a simple pig.

278
00:14:44,689 --> 00:14:46,756
Yeah, guess so.

279
00:14:52,597 --> 00:14:53,763
Good pig. Ugh.

280
00:14:54,729 --> 00:14:57,112
You know what? You're right.
Don't buy the pig.

281
00:14:57,147 --> 00:14:59,027
In fact I'm better off
leaving it with my niece.

282
00:15:00,117 --> 00:15:02,084
No shooting in the house,
sweetie.

283
00:15:02,119 --> 00:15:05,237
But perhaps I could interest you
in something else.

284
00:15:05,289 --> 00:15:08,240
Like these spooky movies!

285
00:15:08,292 --> 00:15:10,025
Movies are great.

286
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:12,094
You watch the movie,
you scare the girl,

287
00:15:12,129 --> 00:15:13,829
the girl snuggles up
next to you.

288
00:15:13,831 --> 00:15:16,564
Next thing you know, you got to
raise a kid, your life falls apart.

289
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,966
Forget that last part.

290
00:15:18,002 --> 00:15:20,902
This next tale is called
Clay Day!

291
00:15:24,308 --> 00:15:27,109
<i>You did it,
Shimmery Twinkleheart!</i>

292
00:15:27,144 --> 00:15:28,977
<i>No, you did it, Cinnamon.</i>

293
00:15:29,013 --> 00:15:32,014
<i>Because you believed
in yourself.</i>

294
00:15:32,049 --> 00:15:33,982
Everything about this is bad.

295
00:15:34,018 --> 00:15:36,885
Well, that just put me 90
minutes closer to death.

296
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:39,022
It's time you kids learn to
watch the classics from my day.

297
00:15:39,073 --> 00:15:41,123
Ooh, old people movies.

298
00:15:41,158 --> 00:15:43,225
Get ready for references
we don't understand

299
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:44,860
and words we can't repeat.

300
00:15:48,332 --> 00:15:51,166
<i>You're no match
for Loinclothiclese.</i>

301
00:15:51,201 --> 00:15:53,168
<i>I've come
for the golden pants.</i>

302
00:15:57,875 --> 00:15:59,091
Oh, no! Mabel!

303
00:15:59,126 --> 00:16:00,842
Well, your sister is broken.

304
00:16:00,878 --> 00:16:03,111
Oh, Grunkle Stan,
I should have told you before

305
00:16:03,147 --> 00:16:05,080
that Mabel
has a childhood terror

306
00:16:05,115 --> 00:16:07,149
of old-timey stop-motion
animation.

307
00:16:07,184 --> 00:16:09,985
It's like her number one fear
since we were kids.

308
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:14,056
Come on, those hokey old
things, how scared could she be?

309
00:16:15,826 --> 00:16:19,127
The Cyclops! His face
is made of nightmares!

310
00:16:19,163 --> 00:16:21,163
Kid, it's just a movie.
It can't hurt you.

311
00:16:21,198 --> 00:16:22,164
No talking.

312
00:16:22,199 --> 00:16:25,867
They wait for you to talk and
then crawl inside your mouth!

313
00:16:25,903 --> 00:16:27,869
Why did you have
to show her that tape?

314
00:16:27,905 --> 00:16:29,805
There's got to be a way
to get her over this!

315
00:16:33,077 --> 00:16:34,042
Huh...

316
00:16:37,915 --> 00:16:40,181
All right, if we can just
get the director to show her

317
00:16:40,217 --> 00:16:42,350
the models are fake,
maybe she'll finally calm down.

318
00:16:42,386 --> 00:16:44,227
I don't know, dude.
According to the internet,

319
00:16:44,254 --> 00:16:47,122
special effects genius Harry Claymore
is some kind of recluse.

320
00:16:47,157 --> 00:16:50,025
Man wants his privacy.
I can respect that.

321
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:54,262
Well, everyone over the fence.

322
00:16:54,298 --> 00:16:57,199
You see, Mabel, those monsters
are just tiny clay figures

323
00:16:57,234 --> 00:17:00,235
moved around one frame at
a time by an antisocial shut-in.

324
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:02,938
Those people
are called animators.

325
00:17:04,208 --> 00:17:05,907
Hello?

326
00:17:05,943 --> 00:17:08,076
Mr. Claymore?

327
00:17:08,112 --> 00:17:09,995
We want to get a look
at your figurines.

328
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:11,863
We're not paparazzi.

329
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:14,149
Aha!

330
00:17:14,184 --> 00:17:17,018
See, Mabel, it's all just
special effects.

331
00:17:17,054 --> 00:17:18,120
You can come out.

332
00:17:18,155 --> 00:17:19,154
No!

333
00:17:19,189 --> 00:17:20,155
Kid, listen to me.

334
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:24,159
For the last time, there is
nothing here to be afraid of--

335
00:17:32,002 --> 00:17:33,268
It's slowly...

336
00:17:34,938 --> 00:17:36,805
swiping at us!

337
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:39,007
Let's escape by standing still!

338
00:17:39,042 --> 00:17:41,176
Oh, it didn't work!

339
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:47,282
Whoa!

340
00:17:56,226 --> 00:17:59,194
How is this happening?
What do they want?

341
00:17:59,229 --> 00:18:01,196
I'm afraid they want you.

342
00:18:03,217 --> 00:18:08,136
Harry Claymore, master of special
effects, circa 1970 something.

343
00:18:08,172 --> 00:18:12,007
Alas, my effects are more
special than you know.

344
00:18:12,059 --> 00:18:13,909
What? But how are
these things real?

345
00:18:13,944 --> 00:18:16,011
- What about stop motion?
- What?

346
00:18:16,046 --> 00:18:17,266
Do you really believe someone

347
00:18:17,281 --> 00:18:19,297
moves these figures
one frame at a time?

348
00:18:19,349 --> 00:18:20,949
I'm not a masochist.

349
00:18:20,984 --> 00:18:23,852
I used black magic to make them
animate themselves.

350
00:18:23,887 --> 00:18:25,954
It was great at first,
but one day...

351
00:18:30,894 --> 00:18:32,160
No!

352
00:18:32,196 --> 00:18:34,796
Where's the heart?!

353
00:18:34,831 --> 00:18:36,798
<i>Now that they were
out of work,</i>

354
00:18:36,833 --> 00:18:39,868
<i>they went mad and enslaved me!</i>

355
00:18:39,903 --> 00:18:43,038
And now they will turn you
into unholy beasts of clay

356
00:18:43,073 --> 00:18:44,906
to join in their mischief!

357
00:18:44,942 --> 00:18:46,441
Well, Mr. Pines,
at least you'll finally

358
00:18:46,476 --> 00:18:48,043
get to work with
your favorite director.

359
00:18:48,078 --> 00:18:51,212
And by work, I mean, suffocate
inside a big wad of clay.

360
00:18:52,149 --> 00:18:53,215
Help!

361
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:55,817
- Somebody help us!
- Help!

362
00:18:55,852 --> 00:18:57,018
Oh, what do I do?

363
00:18:57,054 --> 00:18:59,854
How can I defeat
those monstrosities?

364
00:19:03,093 --> 00:19:06,127
Hey, I changed it into
something I like.

365
00:19:06,163 --> 00:19:09,130
Whoa.
I think I have an idea!

366
00:19:10,267 --> 00:19:12,801
Hey, one-eyed-clops!

367
00:19:12,836 --> 00:19:14,202
Yeah, I'm talking to you,
dum-dum!

368
00:19:14,238 --> 00:19:15,870
Come at me!

369
00:19:24,047 --> 00:19:25,247
Ah!

370
00:19:25,282 --> 00:19:27,916
Wipe that face off your face.

371
00:19:29,253 --> 00:19:32,153
Oh, I've got big plans for you!

372
00:19:32,189 --> 00:19:34,055
Hey, skeleton dorks!

373
00:19:34,091 --> 00:19:36,891
It's "clayback" time!

374
00:19:36,927 --> 00:19:38,260
Whoo-hoo-hoo.

375
00:19:40,147 --> 00:19:42,097
Dude, you conquered your fear.

376
00:19:42,132 --> 00:19:45,817
That's right. Because
she believed in herself.

377
00:19:45,852 --> 00:19:47,035
Can it, Twinkleheart!

378
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:49,170
Just start pounding
those skeletons!

379
00:19:52,109 --> 00:19:53,275
Mabel, you did it!

380
00:19:53,277 --> 00:19:55,010
So you're not scared anymore?

381
00:19:55,045 --> 00:19:59,247
Oh, I'm scared twice as much now,
but now I know it's rational.

382
00:19:59,283 --> 00:20:02,117
Kid, I'm sorry I doubted you.
You were right.

383
00:20:02,152 --> 00:20:04,169
Stop motion is pure evil.

384
00:20:04,221 --> 00:20:06,221
And probably really expensive.

385
00:20:06,256 --> 00:20:08,123
Incredibly expensive.

386
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,860
This is an impressive
fight though.

387
00:20:11,895 --> 00:20:13,194
I'm glad I'm facing towards it.

388
00:20:15,032 --> 00:20:16,197
Yay!

389
00:20:16,233 --> 00:20:17,866
That was the best part.

390
00:20:24,308 --> 00:20:28,109
Well, I think today we learned
that you can remold your fears.

391
00:20:28,145 --> 00:20:30,945
I'm just glad none of us
got turned into clay.

392
00:20:30,981 --> 00:20:32,013
Holy Toledo!

393
00:20:33,917 --> 00:20:36,017
Who wants to see me
change into most anything?

394
00:20:38,355 --> 00:20:42,090
I can walk through walls.
Whoa!

395
00:20:43,126 --> 00:20:46,025
We're safe now, kids.
We're safe.

396
00:20:47,149 --> 00:20:49,020
I don't get it.
You don't want the pig,

397
00:20:49,045 --> 00:20:51,773
you don't want my tapes...
What are you gonna buy?!

398
00:20:52,297 --> 00:20:54,597
How about this delicious potion?

399
00:20:54,621 --> 00:20:56,921
Here, have a free sample.

400
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:07,345
You should have bought my merch
when you had the chance, buddy.

401
00:21:07,369 --> 00:21:08,469
But that's OK.

402
00:21:08,494 --> 00:21:11,793
I'll have some new for
sale very soon...

403
00:21:15,617 --> 00:21:17,676
And here we have our
latest attraction:

404
00:21:17,701 --> 00:21:20,041
The legendary Cheapskate!

405
00:21:20,065 --> 00:21:21,424
I saw it blinking.

406
00:21:21,449 --> 00:21:23,789
Ha! Just an optical illusion.

407
00:21:23,813 --> 00:21:27,013
Come along, everyone.
Step right up!

408
00:21:30,637 --> 00:21:32,337
That's right, I'm a jerk.

409
00:21:32,361 --> 00:21:34,561
Hey!
Wanna play Tic-tac-toe?

410
00:21:37,985 --> 00:21:40,785
Hey! I wanted to be X's!
Let me be X's.

411
00:21:40,809 --> 00:21:42,809
Trust me, just let her be X's.

412
00:21:43,924 --> 00:21:45,324
Yay!

413
00:21:46,048 --> 00:21:48,048
Actually, I'm sorry.
I changed my mind.

414
00:21:48,072 --> 00:21:49,372
I'll be O's.

415
00:21:49,996 --> 00:21:52,085
OK, you're gonna
hate me right now...

416
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:54,320
But is X's still a possibility?

417
00:21:57,444 --> 00:21:59,148
I don't think you're
playing this right...

418
00:21:59,149 --> 00:22:01,149
