1
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:04,260
Zombie attack? Never works.

2
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:04,260
They don't take orders.

3
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:07,890
Blood rain? Ew! Mess up my suit.

4
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:07,890
Heh, no, thank you.

5
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:09,370
Demon caterpillars?

6
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:13,830
Drat! There must be a perfect way

7
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:13,830
to exact vengeance on the Pines family.

8
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:16,950
It's not enough to harm 'em,

9
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:16,950
I need to take something from 'em.

10
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:19,380
Something that'll give me

11
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:19,380
ultimate power!

12
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:20,910
Wait, of course!

13
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:23,320
It's perfect.

14
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:28,950
You've gone too far

15
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:28,950
this time, Duck-tective.

16
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:34,460
Welcome to a world of mystery!

17
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:36,060
Stan Pines?

18
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:38,330
The tax collector! You found me!

19
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:39,900
Ha!

20
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:45,630
Which one of these is the trap door?

21
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:50,100
Mr. Pines, I'm from the

22
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:50,100
Winninghouse Coupon Savers Contest

23
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:54,110
and you are our big winner!

24
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:56,390
Eh?

25
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:58,280
My one and only dream,

26
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:01,050
which was to possess money,

27
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:01,050
has come true!

28
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:02,920
We're rich! I'm gonna get a butler!

29
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:04,580
I'm gonna buy a talking horse!

30
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:08,120
- Just sign here for the money.

31
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:08,120
- You bet!

32
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:09,230
Ha!

33
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,920
Stanford, you fool!

34
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:15,370
You just signed over

35
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:15,370
the Mystery Shack to widdle ol' me!

36
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:16,970
Ah-ha! Cha-cha.

37
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:18,440
- Little ol' me.

38
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:22,100
Uh, you might want to

39
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:22,100
take another look there.

40
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:26,980
"The Shack is hereby signed over

41
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:26,980
to... Suck a lemon, little man."

42
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:30,210
How dare you!

43
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:34,510
I am not a threat to be taken lightly.

44
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:38,260
Come here, hon, I need your arms.

45
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:43,030
I'll get you, Stanford Pines.

46
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:43,030
I'll get you all!

47
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:46,660
- Want to see what else is on TV?

48
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:46,660
- Yeah, okay.

49
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:47,930
- Yeah, all right.

50
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:47,930
- It could be fun.

51
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:49,160
My favorite part is the theme song.

52
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:33,710
Little guy to black space nine.

53
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,640
It's a "Pawn," that's not your color,

54
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,640
and stop stealing the tiny horses.

55
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:40,620
They like it better in here.

56
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:40,620
Don't you, babies?

57
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,350
- And checkmate!

58
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,350
- What?

59
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:46,190
Boo!

60
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,330
Oh!

61
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,990
Dipper wins again!

62
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,160
Yo, Mabel, can you pass

63
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,160
me that brain in the jar?

64
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:52,700
- The lady one.

65
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:52,700
- I got it.

66
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:54,370
Thanks, but Mabel's taller.

67
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:55,660
What? No, she's not.

68
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,010
We're the same height.

69
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,010
We've always been.

70
00:02:58,170 --> 00:02:59,330
Better check again, dude.

71
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:08,680
Yeah. She's got exactly

72
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:08,680
one millimeter on you.

73
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:10,110
- What?

74
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:10,110
- Whoa!

75
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:11,580
Don't you see

76
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:11,580
what's happening, Dipper?

77
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:16,720
This millimeter is just the beginning.

78
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:16,720
I'm evolving into the superior sibling.

79
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:19,060
Bigger! Stronger!

80
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:20,420
Like some kind of alpha twin.

81
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,390
Alpha twin! Alpha twin!

82
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:26,030
Come on, guys,

83
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:26,030
nobody even uses millimeters.

84
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,760
It only makes you

85
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,760
taller than me in Canada.

86
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:30,330
You know, Dipper,

87
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:30,330
I've always wanted a little brother.

88
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:34,240
Who knew I already had one! Yeah!

89
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:37,170
I was awoken by the sound of mockery.

90
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:37,170
Where is it?

91
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:38,780
Show me the object of ridicule!

92
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:41,410
- I'm taller than Dipper.

93
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:41,410
- By one millimeter!

94
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:44,710
Hey-hey.

95
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:44,710
Don't get "short" with your sister.

96
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:49,220
Now, Grunkle Stan,

97
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:49,220
I hope you don't think "little" of him!

98
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:53,120
Yeah! And he's short!

99
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,160
Dude, maybe you should

100
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,160
lay off a tiny bit.

101
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:57,820
Ha! "Tiny!" Soos is in on it now!

102
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,760
No, no, I didn't mean that.

103
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:05,230
Dipper will forget.

104
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:05,230
He's got a three-two-one...

105
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:07,710
- Short term memory!

106
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,810
Pow! We are on fire!

107
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:12,840
Ow! Ooh. That's... Ah!

108
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,620
I high-five hard.

109
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:18,520
Uh! Stupid Mabel. I'm not short!

110
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,460
Oh, come on!

111
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:27,420
There's gotta be some way to get taller.

112
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,760
Let's see...

113
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:34,190
"Legends of miniature buffalo and

114
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:34,190
giant squirrels have led me to believe

115
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:37,810
"there are height-altering properties

116
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:37,810
hidden deep within the forest."

117
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:39,140
Hmm.

118
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:46,570
Oh.

119
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,420
Whoa!

120
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:01,160
- Huh? Oh.

121
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:05,460
Is that mountain lion tiny

122
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:05,460
or just far away in perspective?

123
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:08,470
Perspective! Perspective!

124
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:17,550
It still hurts, but less!

125
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:24,310
Whoa!

126
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:31,820
What the heck.

127
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:48,640
Smaller.

128
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:51,180
Bigger.

129
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:52,580
Too big!

130
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:55,770
I've been buying big clothes.

131
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:55,770
I'll grow into them.

132
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:59,250
Hey, guys.

133
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:59,250
Notice anything different about me?

134
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:01,750
Holy hot-sauce!

135
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:01,750
You've grown an extra millimeter!

136
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,220
What?

137
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,900
What can I say, sis? Growth spurt.

138
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:12,260
Yeah, mine happened first.

139
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:12,260
I'm gonna be taller in the end.

140
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:14,270
- It's science, Dipper.

141
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:14,270
- What?

142
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:17,960
- But, we're the same height now.

143
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:17,960
- Alpha twin! Alpha twin!

144
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:19,270
Oh, yeah?

145
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,210
Something tells me I've got another

146
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,210
growth spurt coming on right now.

147
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:29,420
Give it up, Dipper!

148
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:32,750
What happened?

149
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,390
You know, puberty and stuff.

150
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,720
It doesn't make any sense!

151
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,720
Just a second ago you were...

152
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:41,490
Wait a minute! This is some kind

153
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:41,490
of magicy thing, isn't it?

154
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:43,290
Was it a wizard or something?

155
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:45,630
There's a wizard in this closet,

156
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:45,630
isn't there? Isn't there?

157
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,000
What? No!

158
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:49,700
You're telling me

159
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:49,700
there is not a wizard in this closet?

160
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:52,740
You're telling me

161
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:52,740
that if I open this door right now...

162
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:56,870
Fine! Open it!

163
00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:00,310
An invisible wizard! Really, Dipper?

164
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:06,650
- Oy, you.

165
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:06,650
- Howdy, Stanford! Listen closely.

166
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:10,990
Inside this jar, I have

167
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:10,990
1,000 cursed Egyptian super-termites.

168
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,590
Hand over the deed to your property

169
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,590
or I'll smash this jar with a bat

170
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:17,700
and they'll devour this shack

171
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:17,700
with you inside.

172
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:20,030
- Hey, what's that?

173
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:20,030
- Huh?

174
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,960
Oh, no! Get it off!

175
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:26,740
Hey, Soos, get in here!

176
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:26,740
I want to take pictures of this!

177
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:30,640
Y'all may have won the battle.

178
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:30,640
But mark my words, Stanford!

179
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:33,910
Your family has a weak spot,

180
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:33,910
and I'm gonna find it.

181
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,910
Ahhh! My hair!

182
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:41,850
Does he only respond to incantations?

183
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:41,850
Expecto Wizarium! Wizzle! Wizar...

184
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:42,980
It's not a wizard!

185
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,290
I grew myself

186
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,290
using this magic flashlight!

187
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:49,020
Let me see that thing!

188
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,660
I'll be back for you later!

189
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:01,770
Huh?

190
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:08,540
- Aah!

191
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:08,540
- It's okay. It can shrink things, too.

192
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,880
- Normal-hand-karate-chop!

193
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,880
- Hey!

194
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:21,860
Whoa!

195
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:24,430
Hey, give it back!

196
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,660
Never!

197
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:32,700
Curse the Pines family!

198
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:32,700
Curse Stan! Curse Dipper! Curse...

199
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:36,870
My, my, what delightful manner

200
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:36,870
of doohickery is this?

201
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:38,780
Maybe he didn't see us use it

202
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:43,440
and doesn't know it's a magic flashlight

203
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:43,440
that can grow and shrink things.

204
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:46,590
- Really?

205
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:46,590
- Click. Boop.

206
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,980
No, no, no!

207
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,640
Friends, I wish I was a highway

208
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,640
so I could have the honor

209
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:13,370
of being rode upon by automobiles

210
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:13,370
as fine as these ones right ch'er.

211
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,410
Engine possum at no extra charge.

212
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:17,850
I want that there car!

213
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:23,420
Say there, son, what's in the jar?

214
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:25,560
That's my widdle secret!

215
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:27,130
Aw!

216
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:30,790
Mouth-breathing fools.

217
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,790
Mother.

218
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:44,040
You two.

219
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:45,840
What are you going to do with us?

220
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:50,450
Why, Mabel, I wouldn't hurt a hair

221
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:50,450
on your itty bitty head.

222
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,450
If you agree to be my queen!

223
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:55,060
We live in a democracy. And never!

224
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:58,460
Maybe you'll

225
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:58,460
change your mind after this.

226
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:01,120
No! I will fight you until the day I...

227
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,630
Gummy Koalas!

228
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,100
As for you, boy,

229
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:14,010
tell me, how exactly did you

230
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:14,010
come upon this magic item, hmm?

231
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:18,610
Did somebody tell you about it?

232
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:18,610
Did you read about it somewhere?

233
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:24,450
- Lean closer and I'll tell you.

234
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:24,450
- Well, don't mind if I...

235
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:26,520
- Aah!

236
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:31,860
I could squash you right now!

237
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:38,500
Steel yourself, Gideon.

238
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:38,500
You can use them.

239
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:40,860
You can use them.

240
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:45,200
Soos, this maze of mirrors is your

241
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:45,200
best idea that I'm taking credit for yet!

242
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:48,170
We're gonna make a fortune!

243
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:51,240
- Have my ears always been this big?

244
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:52,810
I'm comin'!

245
00:10:57,650 --> 00:10:58,920
One day.

246
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:01,650
Stanford Pines.

247
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:04,730
Listen to me very closely,

248
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:04,730
I have your niece and nephew.

249
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:06,950
Hand over the deed

250
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:06,950
to the Mystery Shack right now

251
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:09,720
or great harm will befall them!

252
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:11,990
- This is Gideon, by the way.

253
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:14,640
Oh, yeah.

254
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:14,640
This has gotta be your worst plot yet.

255
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,630
They're fine.

256
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,800
I saw them playing

257
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,800
in the yard minutes ago.

258
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:20,200
I have them in my possession!

259
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:20,200
You don't believe me?

260
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:22,570
I will text you a photo.

261
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:25,980
"Text" me a "photo"?

262
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:25,980
Now you're not even speaking English.

263
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:27,140
But...

264
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,050
Hello? Hello!

265
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:32,040
Ahhh!

266
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:39,690
What am I doing? I don't need ransom.

267
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:45,700
I have this! I'll shrink Stan

268
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:45,700
and take the Shack for myself!

269
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:47,560
Y'all will be helpless to stop me!

270
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:50,860
And if any of you

271
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:50,860
step out of line, smash!

272
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:58,710
Gideon, the ice cream

273
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:58,710
truck is here!

274
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,310
Oh. Coming!

275
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:08,290
Guard them, Cheekums. I'm coming!

276
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:18,060
We got to get out of here and save Stan.

277
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:21,100
I know! I will see you later.

278
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:22,670
Okay, how are we going to do this?

279
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:26,040
Gideon's got magic

280
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:26,040
and like a zillion inches on us.

281
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:28,840
On the bright side, at least we're finally

282
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:28,840
the same height again.

283
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:31,610
Actually...

284
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:37,050
You're still taller?

285
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:38,850
Argh! How did this happen?

286
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:40,920
I guess it's another mystery.

287
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:43,990
Just another reason

288
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:43,990
we gotta get that flashlight back.

289
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:51,030
Cheekums, to freedom!

290
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,830
To freedom!

291
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,770
Aw! You're just a big ol' dummy-dum!

292
00:12:58,940 --> 00:12:59,840
I have a plan.

293
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,150
Clean me!

294
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:22,030
Father, could you give widdle ol' me

295
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:22,030
a wide to the Mystery Shack?

296
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,790
Oh, I'd love to, sugar-pie,

297
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:27,300
but I have a heck

298
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:27,300
of a lot of cars to sell, I do.

299
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:32,400
No, no! Don't tickle me! No!

300
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,780
Never! Never tickle me!

301
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,780
What have I told you? What have I...

302
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:38,910
Look at me. What have I told you?

303
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,350
Tickling is no laughing matter.

304
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:44,020
- There we go.

305
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:44,020
- Do you still need a ride?

306
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:47,820
I'll just take the bus!

307
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:49,010
Hiyah!

308
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:51,880
Precious memories.

309
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:54,220
Just keep vacuuming.

310
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,330
Come on!

311
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,030
We need to get higher.

312
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:06,940
Yeah, especially you

313
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:06,940
because you're short.

314
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:08,300
Mabel! Up there.

315
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:18,220
What cute little thing are you off to,

316
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:18,220
you cute little cutey-face?

317
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:22,760
I'm going to annihilate

318
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:22,760
my archenemy's entire family!

319
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,050
Oh. Okay!

320
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:26,720
Yay!

321
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:31,800
He's heading to shrink Stan!

322
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:33,800
Oh, flying discount dollar,

323
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:37,130
if only you could fly us back

324
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:37,130
to the Mystery Shack.

325
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:38,470
Maybe it can.

326
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,710
My sky-high prices!

327
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,370
Yeah!

328
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,370
Whoo-hoo!

329
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:52,310
Down there!

330
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:53,750
Yay!

331
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:53,750
Whoo!

332
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,480
To the Mystery Shack!

333
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,260
Yeah! Whoo-hoo!

334
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,260
Yeah!

335
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:01,020
Oh! Yeah!

336
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:05,800
We're just in time.

337
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:07,960
- But how are we going to stop him?

338
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:09,760
Shoo! Ah!

339
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,740
Leave that to Mabel!

340
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:22,950
I'm coming for you, Stanford. Ow!

341
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:26,120
I'm sorry, gummy friend!

342
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:27,480
It's for the greater good.

343
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:30,050
Ow! One of those

344
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:30,050
infernal Gummy Koalas

345
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,850
has gotten into my perfect hair!

346
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:35,430
I can't defeat Stan looking like this!

347
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:40,200
Whoo! Whoo-ee!

348
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:42,300
Quick. Get in front and I'll re-grow you.

349
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:45,910
Okay. Wait, you're gonna grow

350
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:45,910
us back to equal height, right?

351
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:47,800
Dipper! That doesn't matter right now!

352
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,840
Well, if it doesn't matter

353
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,840
then why don't you just do it?

354
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:51,950
Argh! Why are you acting so weird?

355
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:54,880
Why can't you just accept

356
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:54,880
that I'm a little bit taller than you?

357
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:56,450
Oh, I'm acting weird?

358
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:59,150
You're the one

359
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:59,150
who keeps calling me names and stuff!

360
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:02,090
- Oh, what? You mean like Little...

361
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:02,090
- Don't say it!

362
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:04,380
Little Dipper.

363
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,550
- Ah!

364
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:10,330
I dare say you would've defeated me,

365
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:10,330
if it wasn't for your sibling bickering.

366
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:16,970
The Shack is mine, Stanford Pines!

367
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:20,870
No!

368
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:24,380
Well, well, Stanford, it appears

369
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:24,380
I've finally gotten the best of...

370
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:25,540
Huh?

371
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:26,900
What!

372
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:30,020
All right,

373
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:30,020
something's definitely different here.

374
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:33,010
Whoa!

375
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:34,420
Tell me where Stan is!

376
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:36,320
Never! You'll never find Stan.

377
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:38,190
On the second door

378
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:38,190
to the left down the hall.

379
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,890
Wait, why did I say that?

380
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:44,520
Stanford, I'm coming for ya!

381
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:51,940
I guess I kind of Soosed that one up,

382
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:51,940
didn't I?

383
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:53,100
It's not your fault, Soos.

384
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:55,610
I'm the guy who put together

385
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:55,610
that shrinking device.

386
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:58,470
I guess it's just...

387
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:58,470
You kept teasing me, Mabel.

388
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:02,450
Like, all day. What was that all about?

389
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:06,180
I guess it's that,

390
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:06,180
you're better at me at, like, everything.

391
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:09,090
And you always rub it in my face.

392
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:13,020
Chess, checkers, ping pong.

393
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:17,860
I guess I finally felt like I was winning

394
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:17,860
at something for once.

395
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:20,590
Oh, man, now I feel like a big jerk.

396
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:23,400
Don't you mean a little jerk?

397
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:25,870
- Oh.

398
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,600
All right, I walked into that one.

399
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,600
Are we cool?

400
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:30,600
- We're cool.

401
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:30,600
- Am I cool?

402
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:33,310
- You're cool, Soos.

403
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:33,310
- Yes!

404
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:38,350
Stanford!

405
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,420
Oh, hi, Gideon!

406
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:42,320
I've been looking for someone

407
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:42,320
to try out my new mirror maze.

408
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:46,050
Then again, you're an idiot.

409
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:46,050
That's the end of the sentence.

410
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:47,460
You come back here!

411
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,190
Try and find me, twerp.

412
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:55,900
Let's get that flashlight

413
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:55,900
before Gideon gets Stan.

414
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:58,940
There it is!

415
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:05,040
Whoa! His hair's so shiny.

416
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:07,340
No! Don't look directly at it!

417
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:11,510
This neck is really squishy.

418
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:11,510
Look! I'm making fat angels!

419
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:14,180
Ew! Termites!

420
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:17,450
Tell my story!

421
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:18,650
Oh.

422
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:21,660
Hey, there you are!

423
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:25,190
Thought you could get away

424
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:25,190
from me, eh, corn chip?

425
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:34,140
Eh!

426
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:36,280
Ah!

427
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:40,540
Ahhh!

428
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:43,680
No!

429
00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:47,950
Hey, watch the merchandise!

430
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:54,460
You little troll!

431
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:58,500
These mirrors cost me 10...

432
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:58,500
I mean, 25... Five hun...

433
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:01,260
$500 each.

434
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:01,260
And you're paying for all of 'em!

435
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,060
Au contraire, it will be you who pays!

436
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,540
Grunkle Stan is doomed!

437
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:07,730
Not completely doomed! To his armpit!

438
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:11,140
- Uh-uh.

439
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:11,140
- Just, come on!

440
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:12,640
Whoa! What is that thing?

441
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:16,510
Finally, after all these years,

442
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:16,510
after every humiliation!

443
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:20,020
Your business, your family,

444
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:20,020
everything will finally be mine!

445
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:22,090
You have no one to protect you now!

446
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:26,560
Prepare for the wrath of Gideon Glee...

447
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:26,560
Gideon Glee...

448
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:34,700
Uh. I don't even know

449
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:34,700
how to respond to this.

450
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:37,130
No! Stop it!

451
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:40,600
Look, kid.

452
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:40,600
I think this rivalry thing is getting to you.

453
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:44,510
Ha. I understand, I mean,

454
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:44,510
I'm a formidable foe, what can I say.

455
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:47,340
No!

456
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,250
Hey, now, come on.

457
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,250
You'll get me one of these days.

458
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:54,220
Maybe, you know, run your evil plan

459
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:54,220
by some friends next time, huh?

460
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:58,550
Workshop it.

461
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:58,550
But first get your issues in order there.

462
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:05,390
Up, up. Over the carpet, there we go,

463
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:08,200
around the end table and out the door.

464
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:09,630
Whoa!

465
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:13,300
My light!

466
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:15,770
You're the light of my life, too, pal.

467
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:17,110
Whoo!

468
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,300
Freak show.

469
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:25,150
- After you.

470
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:25,150
- It's okay, you can go first if you want...

471
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:35,390
Hey, you let me keep

472
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:35,390
my extra millimeter!

473
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,500
You earned it.

474
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:39,790
- Aw, thanks, "Little brother."

475
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:39,790
- Stop it.

476
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:42,140
Guess we should destroy this thing.

477
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:45,800
You know, so it doesn't fall

478
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:45,800
into the wrong hands and junk.

479
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:49,540
Seems like the smart thing to do.

480
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:51,700
Die! Die!

481
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,750
There you dudes are!

482
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,520
I've been trying to get your attention!

483
00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:00,250
- Glue.

484
00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:00,250
- Lots of glue.

485
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:03,480
Oh, son, don't you mind

486
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:03,480
that Stanford Pines.

487
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:06,150
You'll get your revenge

488
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:06,150
one of these days.

489
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:08,660
No! It's not just about revenge!

490
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:11,820
I want that shack. The physical building.

491
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,220
But why?

492
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:17,130
Because it holds a secret

493
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:17,130
you couldn't possibly imagine.

494
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:21,500
Uh, sweetie, you want some ice cream?

495
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,200
Did you pick out all the nuts?

496
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:24,810
Mmm-hmm.

497
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:29,780
Little more?

498
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:34,780
That's good.

499
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:39,590
Mr. Pines, I'm from the Winninghouse

500
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:39,590
Coupon Savers Contest

501
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,390
and you are our big winner!

502
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:47,570
I guess we'll have to give the prize

503
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:47,570
to our runner-up winner.

504
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:52,140
"Fiddleford H. McGucket."

505
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:55,140
How would you like $10,000,000?

506
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:57,370
It's my dream come true!

507
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:02,250
Cross this town off our list.
